Many beginners struggle with pricing because they forget to account for all the costs involved in selling online, including payment gateway fees, platform fees, and shipping costs. This calculator helps you determine the right selling price that covers all your costs while achieving your desired profit margin, ensuring your business remains profitable.",
        "formula": "How is the fair price calculated?",
        "formulaContent": "The formula used is: Selling Price = (Product Cost + Shipping Cost) ÷ (1 - Profit Margin% - Gateway Fee% - Platform Fee%). For example, if your product costs $20, shipping is $5, you want a 30% profit margin, gateway fee is 2.5%, and platform fee is 15%, then: Selling Price = (20 + 5) ÷ (1 - 0.30 - 0.025 - 0.15) = 25 ÷ 0.525 = $47.62. This ensures that after all deductions, you still make your desired 30% profit.",

        "whyNeedContent": "Pricing products correctly is one of the biggest challenges for new sellers. Price too low and you lose money; price too high and you lose customers. Many sellers make the mistake of simply adding a markup to their cost without considering all the fees that will be deducted from each sale. This tool helps you: calculate the exact price needed to achieve your profit goals, understand how fees impact your margins, compare pricing strategies for different sales channels, avoid the common mistake of underpricing your products, and build a sustainable and profitable business from day one."

For example, if you invest $10,000, expect $15,000 revenue over 12 months with $2,000 ongoing costs: Net Profit = $3,000, ROI = 30%, Annualized ROI = 30%, Payback Period = 40 months.",

        "whatIsContent": "The Smart Image Compressor intelligently reduces the file size of your product images while maintaining visual quality. Unlike basic compression tools that apply the same settings to all images, our smart compressor analyzes each image individually to determine the optimal compression level. This ensures your product photos look crisp and professional while loading quickly. The tool supports JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats, making it versatile for all your e-commerce image needs.",
        "formula": "How does image compression work?",
        "formulaContent": "Image compression uses algorithms to reduce file size while preserving visual quality. Lossy compression removes data that human eyes can't easily perceive, using techniques like chroma subsampling (reducing color information) and quantization (reducing precision of color values). The compression ratio depends on quality settings - at 80% quality, you typically achieve 60-70% file size reduction with minimal visible difference. Smart compression analyzes each image to find the optimal balance between size and quality.",
        "whyNeed": "Why do merchants need this?",
        "whyNeedContent": "Large image files are the #1 cause of slow e-commerce websites. Slow sites lead to higher bounce rates, lower conversions, and poor SEO rankings. This compressor helps you: reduce image sizes by 50-80% without noticeable quality loss, improve page load speed dramatically, enhance mobile shopping experience, reduce hosting storage and bandwidth costs, improve Google Core Web Vitals scores, and maintain professional-looking product images that convert browsers into buyers."

Industry benchmarks vary: general e-commerce averages 2-3%, fashion 1.5-2.5%, electronics 1-2%, luxury goods 0.5-1%. A 'good' conversion rate depends on your industry, traffic source, and price point. Paid traffic typically converts higher than organic traffic.",

The analyzer provides specific recommendations - if you're below market average, it suggests price increase opportunities. If you're above average, it warns about potential sales volume impact. Smart pricing isn't just about covering costs; it's about finding the sweet spot where you maximize both sales and margins."

It helps you understand the true impact of discounts on your profit margins and calculates exactly how many additional units you need to sell to maintain the same total profit. Many merchants offer discounts without realizing how dramatically they affect profitability. A 20% discount doesn't just reduce profit by 20% - it can cut your margin in half or more, requiring significantly higher sales volume to compensate.",

Discounted Margin = (Discounted Price - Cost) / Discounted Price × 100. Break-Even Units = Current Sales × (Original Margin / Discounted Margin). For example, if your product costs 60 SAR and sells for 100 SAR (40% margin), a 20% discount drops the price to 80 SAR and margin to 25%. To maintain the same profit, you'd need to sell 60% more units.",

It's especially valuable during seasonal sales, clearance events, or when competing on price. Smart merchants use this tool to ensure their promotions actually increase total profit, not just revenue."

        "whatIsContent": "AI Inventory Forecaster is an advanced tool that uses artificial intelligence to analyze your sales data and predict when each product will run out of stock. The tool is designed specifically for merchants and e-commerce store owners in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, taking into account local seasons like Ramadan, Eid, and White Friday. Instead of unpleasant surprises with stockouts and sales interruptions, you'll get early alerts and accurate recommendations for quantities to order and when.",
        "howItWorks": "How does the Inventory Forecaster work?",
        "howItWorksContent": "The forecaster works in four stages: First, it analyzes your sales data for the past months and calculates the average daily sales for each product. Second, it detects sales trends (increasing, stable, decreasing) and adjusts predictions accordingly. Third, it discovers seasonal patterns and predicts demand increases in upcoming seasons. Fourth, it calculates the stockout date for each product and compares it with lead time to identify critical products that need immediate ordering.",
        "whyNeed": "Why do you need this tool?",
        "whyNeedContent": "Inventory stockout is one of the biggest causes of lost sales in e-commerce. When a popular product runs out, you lose sales and may lose the customer forever. On the other hand, ordering too much freezes capital and increases storage costs. This tool helps you find the perfect balance: know when to order, how much to order, and prepare for seasons in advance. The result: continuous sales without interruption, and efficiently utilized capital."

Instead of relying only on ROAS (which can be misleading), the tool calculates the true ROI for each campaign after deducting product costs.

The result: you know exactly which campaign is making you money and which is losing you money.",

        "howItWorksContent": "The auditor works in three stages: First, it reads your ad report and extracts data for each campaign (spend, clicks, conversions). Second, it links campaigns with actual sales from your store and calculates real revenue for each campaign. Third, it calculates true ROI = (Revenue - Spend - Product Cost) / Spend × 100.
